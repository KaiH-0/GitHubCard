# GitHubCard
This is a layout people can use on their website to show their github.
There are two versions, one is using the github api to grab your repo information etc to show your profile whereas the other is all just html, bootstrap and css.

API Version doesn't require anything apart from the card.js and card.css to work. The API version can cause some issues with bootstrap so you may have to use the HTML version, I am still trying to figure out why this happens.
The HTML Version requires bootstrap and the github.css, these are both already included.
